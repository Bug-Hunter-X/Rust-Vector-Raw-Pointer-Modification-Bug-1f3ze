This repository contains a simple Rust program that demonstrates a subtle bug involving raw pointers and vector modification. The program modifies a vector through a raw pointer after the vector might have been reallocated internally, which can lead to unexpected behavior, including crashes or data corruption. The solution showcases a safe way to interact with vectors using Rust's built-in methods instead of raw pointers.
